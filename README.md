# Minesweeper

## Introduction
A simple Minesweeper game on a 8x8 grid. There are 14 mines in total.
Open all safe tiles and you win. If you click on a mine tile, you lose.

## Notes
Most other Minesweeper apps have a flagging function that lets you place flags on potential mine tiles. I don't know yet if I will install that function here in the future.
